## Introduction

Welcome to the AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction Chatbot! This chatbot utilizes machine learning to provide diabetes risk predictions based on user inputs. This README provides instructions on how to run the code and lists the necessary dependencies.

## Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Flask (for creating a web-based chatbot interface)
- Scikit-Learn (for loading the trained prediction model)
- Natural Language Processing libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, or similar, for chatbot language understanding)
- Relevant machine learning libraries and models (for diabetes prediction)
- Any additional libraries or tools specific to your chatbot implementation


# Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

Change to the project directory:

cd diabetes-chatbot

Install any additional dependencies specific to your chatbot implementation. Ensure that you have the necessary machine learning models for diabetes prediction.

# Usage

This project consists of the following main components:

Chatbot: The chatbot application code, including chatbot logic and web interface.
Machine Learning Model: The trained model for diabetes prediction.
# Chatbot Interaction
To run the chatbot, follow these steps:

Navigate to the chatbot directory:

cd chatbot

Run the chatbot application:

python app.py


The chatbot will start, and you can access it through a web browser at http://localhost:5000 (or a different address if specified).

# Training the Model
The machine learning model for diabetes prediction should be trained and saved separately. Make sure to train the model using the relevant dataset and preprocessing steps before deploying it with the chatbot.

Create a directory for your model, e.g., model.

Train the model and save it to the model directory.

Update the chatbot code (app.py) to load the trained model during chatbot interactions.

# Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community. If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or improvements to the chatbot or prediction model, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow our contribution guidelines.
